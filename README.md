#Generative AI Models Project

This repository contains a detailed exploration of generative AI models, demonstrated through a Jupyter notebook. The project focuses on implementing cutting-edge generative algorithms to create synthetic data in various formats, showcasing their potential in creative and practical applications.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to experiment with and understand the architecture of generative models, such as:

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)
Transformers for text generation (like GPT-based models)
These models are trained to generate new, high-quality content in domains like text, images, and more.

Key Features
Custom Implementations: Detailed code implementations of popular generative models.
Dataset Flexibility: The notebook allows users to train models on custom datasets.
Model Evaluation: Includes tools to assess the quality of generated outputs.
Applications: This project explores how generative models can be applied to tasks such as image synthesis, text generation, and other creative applications.
